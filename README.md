# CS370 - Team Programming and Creative Problem Solving 
* Description: Gives students practice in solving challenging problems by applying algorithmic problem solving techniques learned in prior courses.  Students will develop their problem-solving, algorithm-creation, and programming abilities.  Problems will be complex and will require invention of an algorithm, not simply straightforward application of standard techniques.  Students will work in teams.  To provide a focus point and to help make the course fun, students will program their solutions in a style similar to that employed by programming competitions such as the national ACM programming contest.
